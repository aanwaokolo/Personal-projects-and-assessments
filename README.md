# ü´Ä Heart Failure Prediction with Machine Learning

## üìå Project Overview

This project focuses on building a predictive model to estimate the probability of mortality among patients with heart failure. Using structured clinical data, the model aims to identify high-risk patients by analyzing physiological and laboratory features such as age, ejection fraction, creatinine levels, and blood pressure.

The goal is to enable early risk detection and support data-driven decisions in healthcare.

## üîç Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Checked for nulls and datatypes
   - Normalized numerical features using `StandardScaler`

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Histograms and pie charts for distribution of key features
   - Correlation heatmap for feature relationships

3. **Model Training**
   - Trained 3 models:
     - Decision Tree
     - K-Nearest Neighbors
     - Logistic Regression

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy score
   - Confusion matrix
   - Classification report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
